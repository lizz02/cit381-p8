# MySQL Database and Accessing Data (CIT381 Project)

This project centered around creating a relational database. I chose to create a database modeled off a video game "inventory." The image below is a graphic representation of my database:

By using SQL and NodeJS, I was able to create a server which would allow the client to view/search for data, add and delete data, and update preexisting data.
